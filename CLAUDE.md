# 1997 Labs site — notes for Claude

Read this before working here; it replaces re-reading the whole page.

- Site lives in `site/`. One page (`index.html`, ~90 KB, inline CSS and JS; the owner's chosen "Design ★" from Oct 2026: light by default with a dark switch, English/Arabic switch), plus `privacy.html`, `404.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `assets/`.
- Brand rules and what to preserve: `CLAUDE-HANDOFF.md`. Positioning and palette: `1997-LABS-BRAND-PROFILE.md`.
- English copy is in the HTML. Arabic lives in the `AR` dictionary in the page script and is applied only when a visitor picks Arabic (`data-i18n` keys); every `data-i18n` key needs an Arabic entry (a test checks this). Arabic text should be checked by a native speaker.
- Colours are theme tokens in the last `:root` / `[data-theme="light"]` blocks; the accent token is named `--lime` but is blue (light `#3E5BD8`, dark `#8AA2FF`). Do not reintroduce red (`#FF3B30`). Fonts are self-hosted in `site/assets/fonts/` (Manrope, IBM Plex Sans Arabic; OFL); never load Google Fonts.
- Keep the "AI & Software Company" descriptor next to the logo and in the title and description.
- Example figures (the +38% in the hero and the "business runs itself" scene) must keep the "not client results" note.
- Tests: `python -m pytest` (assets, links, descriptor, colours, metadata, image budget under 400 KB each and 1 MB total).
- Inspect `index.html` with targeted `grep` or short scripts instead of reading it whole. Check visuals with one screenshot per change, not repeated loops.
- Domain: `https://1997labs.com/` (owner confirmed). Hosting: a new GitHub repository with GitHub Pages, created only after the owner approves the preview.
- WhatsApp number lives in one constant, `WHATSAPP_NUMBER`, in the page script; every `[data-wa]` link uses it. The free-evaluation form sends the visitor's details through WhatsApp.
- "Our work" (`#work`, the 3D carousel; cards are written in the HTML) shows client projects as screenshots (`site/assets/work-*.webp`, 1200 px wide, WebP q80) with no links. The owner confirmed they built them; only state facts visible in the projects.
- Never create videos or screen recordings (including Playwright `recordVideo`) unless the owner explicitly asks for one. Still screenshots are the default preview.
- The owner reviews screenshots before every deploy. Work on a branch and merge to `main` (which deploys) only after approval.
- Token protocol (owner's standing rule): send detailed test/build output to `logs/unit_<id>.log` (gitignored), never into chat; run only the checks for files you changed while iterating, and the full `python -m pytest` once per batch; report in the short STATUS / SUMMARY / UNITS / FILES / ISSUES / LOG format; no repo-wide searching when the file paths are known.
- Chatbot: free AI chat. `worker/` (Cloudflare Worker, MiniMax; `POST /api/chat`, `POST /api/lead`), UI `site/assets/review.js` (exposes `window.RV`; the page's `[data-open-chat]` buttons open it and are hidden until `REVIEW_API` is set). The AI picks services only from `worker/src/pricing.js` (owner's sheet; business websites capped 10% below the 8,000 AED market price); the server prices them (2 core items + up to 3 optional extras, not in the total). The AI never sees prices and `cleanChat` replaces any reply mentioning money. Prices are NEVER shown to visitors while `SHOW_PRICES` (worker/wrangler.toml) is "false": the visitor sees the plan, and the priced quote plus the conversation is emailed to the owner to approve and send themselves. All prices are in AED, excl. 5% VAT. Website checks reach the AI as extracted facts only, never raw HTML.
